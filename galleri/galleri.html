            <p class="bildtext">On Aug. 23, 1966, NASA's Lunar Orbiter 1 snapped the first photo of Earth as seen from lunar orbit. While a remarkable image at the time, the full resolution of the image was never retrieved from the mission's data. In 2008, this earthrise image was restored by the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project at NASA Ames Research Center.</p>

            <p class="bildtext">Oblique (very!) view of a crater on the far side of the Moon, as imaged by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Known as the Einthoven cold spot crater, it is located at 109.91° E, 6.74° S. White rays and the crater's rocky rim and rugged interior wall are visible signs of youth. A "cold spot anomaly" surrounding the crater is another sign of youth. The anomaly extends far beyond the three-kilometer width of this image, but is invisible to human eyes.</p>

            <p class="bildtext">This photograph of astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Apollo 11 commander, was taken inside the Lunar Module (LM) while the LM rested on the lunar surface. Astronauts Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot, had already completed their historic extravehicular activity (EVA) when this picture was made. Astronaut Michael Collins, command module pilot, remained with the Command and Service Modules (CSM) in lunar orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin explored the Moon's surface.</p>
